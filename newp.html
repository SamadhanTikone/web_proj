            <hr>
<p>"I was quite disappointed with my recent stay at this hotel. The room I was assigned felt outdated and in need of renovation. The service was lackluster, with long wait times at the front desk and unhelpful staff. I also encountered issues with the cleanliness of the room, which left me feeling uncomfortable. Additionally, the noise levels were higher than expected, making it difficult to get a good night's rest. Overall, I had higher expectations for the price I paid."</p>
